## 🧑‍🔬 Trevor Keller, PhD 🛠️

__Scientist and Sysadmin__ thriving at the intersection of mathematical models, high-performance computing, and data storage.
Specializing in Linux clusters and solid-state microstructure evolution in metals. Passionate about building a better tomorrow.

- 🏳️‍⚧️ My pronouns are they/them/theirs.
- 🔭 I’m looking for remote-friendly opportunities in research software engineering and Linux systems administration.
- 🌱 I'm learning about PETSc and spectral methods for PDEs.
- 🪨 I'm easily distracted by cool rocks. Every rock is a cool rock.
- 💬 Ask me about `git`, high-performance computing (HPC), grain growth in metals, really anything of a technical nature!
